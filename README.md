# Hyperarameter-Tuning-with-Tensorflow-using-MNIST-Data

Hyperparamater tuning with tensorflow was used in this project using MNIST Data set. 

### FEATURES
The data was split into the test and training part 
From Tensorflow Keras Adam optimizer was imported and utilzed with 0.001 learing rate. The learning rate was later change to check the effect on the model, but the lower rate of 0.001 was best for the model because the model was able to learn slowly and better.

# Model 1
The base model: 

# Model 2 
Adding paranmeters to the Base model and still keeping the base model optimzer 

# Model 3 
Increasing the learning rate: The rate was increased to 0.1 and also reduce to 0.000001 the model was either learn too fast or too slow 

# Model 4
Greatly adding to the number parameter 

# Model 5
Adding regularization/ Dropout to reduce overfitting
